And it goes
And it goes
And it goes a little something like this.
Hit it!
Here we go!
Yo guys check it out,
Guess what happened to me?
(Another crazy story?, come on ac?)
I was hanging at the court, just playing some ball
working on my game (yeah, we heard it all)
i heard the fans screaming, i thought it was for me
but then i saw a shadow, it was 12ft 3
it was Shaquille O'neal (what? what did he say?)
(How about some one on one?
you wanna play?)
I told him why not I got some time
But when I beat you real bad try not to cry.
(Please, Aaron are you for real?
One on One with Shaquille O'Neal?)
Ya, 34 center from the LA lakers
You must of been nervous.
I knew I could take him.
Scared of Shaq?
Phsyc him out
I said O'Neal you're in my house now
Start the game, the whistle blows
Pay attention close guys, the story goes



It's like BOOM (boom)
I put it in the hoop like SLAM (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming out Jam(jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts.
' cause that's how I beat shaq.

So check it out
I thought I had the lead.
But then he started scoring mad points on me
I was scoring up bricks
(Was he hitting all the shots?)
I knew there was a way that I could make it stop
I had a plan, I could change the pace
I said "Yo, Shaq you didn't tie your shoe lace (huh?)
He looked down, I stole the ball
I'm takin him to school now
watch me yall
a three pointer, nothing but net
come on Shaq, had enough yet?
Down by two, I'm catching up
I guess he's getting nervous
because you know it ain't luck


cuz that's how I beat shaq

dunk after dunk
Jam after jam
cheerleaders are cheerin' "Aaron's the man"
dunk after dunk
jam after jam
cheerleaders are cheerin' "Aaron's the man"

announcers were shocked
couldn't believe it was real
(I can't believe a kid just stuffed O'Neal!)
One more second then it was all that remained
I put the ball up
I put him to shame
I must admit that it sounds real crazy
but the ball went in and then he cried like a baby.

Sorry Shaq I should have let you win
You're good too
And we can still be friends
Fans went nuts
They put me on their shoulders
Then I heard a voice
and it sounded like my mothers
"get up for school, you're gonna be late"
"Mom, can't you see that I'm playing a game"
"how can you be playing if you're still in bed?
Are you getting sick? Did you hit your head?"

Oh man it was all a dream
I guess that kind of thing could never happen to me
If it was a dream
And it wasn't real
How'd I get a jersey with a name O'Neal?
