## [See zx for context](https://github.com/google/zx)

zx is a scripting tool that basically wraps Node into a more user-friendly context.

Even though I don't think it's a replacement for Bash, like it claims to be, it's good for people with more JS experience.

Please not you need to run npm install for some scripts to work.


## Scripts

|scripts|function|
|:--:|:--:|
|moveFiles| Moves all files of a particular extension from user inputted sources to user inputted destination.|
|deleteVideos| Deletes all quicktime videos that Apple Saves automatically.|
|moveScreenshots|Moves any default MacOS Screenshots to an appropriate folder|

The rest of the scripts just follow the same purpose of `moveScreenshots`.



Are these all for my obessive need to hoard images? No comment.
