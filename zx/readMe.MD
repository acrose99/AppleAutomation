## [See zx for context](https://github.com/google/zx)

zx is a scripting tool that basically wraps Node into a more user-friendly context.

Even though I don't think it's a replacement for Bash, like it claims to be, it's actually a good way to learn Node! Thus, I'm rewriting some Applescript scripts into ZX.


## Scripts

|scripts|function|
|:--:|:--:|
|moveKrita|Moves any Krita files to an appropriate folder|
|movePhotoshop|Moves any Photoshop files to an appropriate folder|
|moveDigitalArt| Wrapper for the above functions | 
|moveScreenshots|Moves any default MacOS Screenshots to an appropriate folder|
|moveUnknownImages|Moves any images that aren't Screenshots, Krita, and/or Photoshop files to an appropiate folder|
|deleteVideos|Deletes any default MacOS Videos not saved correctly by Quicktime|

Are these all for my obessive need to hoard images? No comment.
