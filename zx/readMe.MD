## [See zx for context](https://github.com/google/zx)

zx is a scripting tool that basically wraps Node into a more user-friendly context.

Even though I don't think it's a replacement for Bash, like it claims to be, it's actually a good way to learn Node! Thus, I'm rewriting some Applescript scripts into ZX.
