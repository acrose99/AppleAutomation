# Apple Automation

I’ve semi-gotten into automating my Apple ecosystem using a combination of apps/languages

* Automator App/Applescript
* Zsh (My profile is a mess right now, but I’ll update eventually)
* More recently, I've been using zx to create node scripts. 

There’s nothing to crazy here but there is a *severe* lack of documentation on Automator and AppleScript from what I could tell in the past couple days. Apple’s documentation sucks, there are like 5 repos, and stackexchange won’t save you. This is my simple way to help any new people getting into this niche. If you somehow find this and wanna add to it, pls make a pull request!
