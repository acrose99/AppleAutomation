I definitely need to play around with WebKit to start getting a better understanding of this.

Currently, LowKeyRedditViewer opens the top 100 posts from a subreddit and displays only the images in a minimal UI. This is good for subs like /r/pics where you just want to ignore the context, or avoid opening the app.
