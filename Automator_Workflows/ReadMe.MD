These are super simple but again, theres like no documentation for Automator.

In case anyone needs help:

* Groovy just plays a playlist automatically, without opening the Music App
* Move Screenshots moves any screenshots (with the default name) to a folder called "Screenshots"
* Startup Application is meant to open as a login item, or you can use it to reset your desktop. This is more personal since it's my preferred minimal setup (Terminal, Firefox, Music, and Bear for note taking) but you can repurpose it in minutes.
